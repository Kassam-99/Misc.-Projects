# Simple Socket Chat

 - Simple chat project, exchanging messages between server and one client. 
 - Written in Python.
 - The code uses the concept of sockets and threading.

## Requirements

In order to run the project, you'll need to have Python 3.7.6 or greater.
This server and client can only be set up on a local area network.

## Running the project

For running the project, you will need to have two computers one for server and one for client.

- Creating the server:
    If you are using Python 3.7.6, Run the following command below to start 
    running server:

    $ python3 server.py



- Creating clients:

    Now we are going to need one clients, in order to see each other message on terminal.
