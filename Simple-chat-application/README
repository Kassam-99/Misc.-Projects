Simple Socket Chat

Simple chat project, written in Python using sockets for college network class.
Requirements

In order to run the project, you'll need to have Python 3.7.6 or greater, in case that you already have it you can go to next section: Running the project. If you don't have it you can use pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv for download python and create your python environment for running the project.

I'm going to leave below a tutorial of how to configure your environment for running the project using pyenv with pyenv-virtualenv.
Installing Python with pyenv

$ pyenv install 3.7.6

Creating virtual environment

$ pyenv virtualenv 3.7.6 socketchat

Using the virtual environment

$ pyenv activate socketchat

Running the project

For running the project, you will need to have an server to receive and send messages to clients that are connected, and at least 2 clients to see messages being broadcasted.

    Creating the server:

    If you are using Python 3.7.6 without pyenv, run the following command below to start running server:

    $ python3 server.py

    If you are using pyenv, just run the following command to up the server:

    (socketchat) $ python server.py

    Creating clients:

    Now we are going to need two clients, in order to see each other message on terminal.

    If you are using Python 3.7.6 without pyenv, run the following command in two different terminals/bashes in order to create our clients and exchange messagens between them.

    $ python3 client.py

    Otherwise if you are using pyenv, simply run the following code in different terminals/bashes:

    (socketchat) $ python client.py

    If you are a client and want to quit from chat, simply write quit and you will be disconnected from the chat.
